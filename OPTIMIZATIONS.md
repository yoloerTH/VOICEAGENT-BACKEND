# Backend Optimizations

## Changes Made

### 1. CORS Configuration ✅
- Added new Railway backend URL to allowed origins
- Added `allowedHeaders` for better security
- Allows both WebSocket and polling transports

### 2. Socket.io Optimizations ✅
- **pingTimeout**: 60000ms (1 minute) - Keeps connections alive
- **pingInterval**: 25000ms (25 seconds) - Regular health checks
- **maxHttpBufferSize**: 100 MB - Handles large audio streams
- **transports**: ['websocket', 'polling'] - Fallback support

### 3. Session Management ✅
- Added `lastActivity` timestamp to track session usage
- Automatic cleanup of stale sessions every 5 minutes
- Sessions inactive for 30+ minutes are cleaned up
- Prevents memory leaks from abandoned connections

### 4. Deepgram Service ✅
- Updated to latest SDK (v4.11.3)
- Simplified configuration for better compatibility
- Better error handling with detailed logging
- Connection timeout (10 seconds)
- Proper event handler cleanup

### 5. Error Handling ✅
- Better error messages with context
- Graceful degradation on API failures
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 6. Logging Improvements ✅
- Shows CORS allowed origins on startup
- Tracks connection/disconnection events
- Logs transcript reception
- Shows cleanup operations

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Automatic session cleanup
- **Better Reliability**: Ping/pong keeps connections stable
- **Faster Recovery**: Connection timeouts prevent hanging
- **Easier Debugging**: Comprehensive logging

## Next Steps

1. Push all changes to GitHub
2. Railway will auto-deploy
3. Update Netlify environment variable:
   - `VITE_SERVER_URL=https://voice-ai-backend-production-7a80.up.railway.app`
4. Test the connection!
